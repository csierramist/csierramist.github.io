    <h1>What is a Sage?</h1>
    <p>A <a href="http://jakanddaxter.wikia.com/wiki/Sage" target="_blank">sage</a> is a master of a certain type of eco. With studying eco for a long period of time, a person will become very exposed to it. Over time a sage's skin will change to the color of the eco they are studying. A sage has the power to channel eco which in turn gives them the abilities that the eco possesses.
