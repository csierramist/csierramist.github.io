    <h1>What is Eco?</h1>
    <p><a href="http://jakanddaxter.wikia.com/wiki/Eco" target="_blank">Eco</a> is a powerful substance that exists, in one form or another, throughout the entire Jak and Daxter series. It comes in many forms such as small clusters, gas, and in large quantaties it becomes liquid. There are six known different types of eco that represent different types of qualities. There is green eco, red eco, blue eco, yellow eco, and light and dark eco. In the first game, eco is very abundant and can be found almost everywhere. The humans who study eco and become masters of it are known as <a href="../sub2/index.html">Sages</a>. However only green, light, and dark eco remain in their natural form in the rest of the games. The other types are in the form of gun mods that are used in the rest of the series.</p>
    <h2>Types of Eco    </h2>
    <h3>Green Eco</h3>
    <p>Green eco represents life. Throughout the series it is used to regenerate health and heal and sometimes even used as fuel. It is 1 of 4 ecos used to make light eco. The sage of green eco is Samos Hagai. It takes the shape of small green orbs or in a large cluster. It is one of the 3 ecos that remains in its natural form throughout the series. There is no gun mod for green eco however it takes the shape as health boxes.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
    <h3>Red Eco </h3>
    <p>Red eco represents short ranged power and strength. It is 1 of 4 ecos used to make light eco. The sage of red eco is the Red Eco Sage. It takes the shape of  red orb gas clusters and it also comes out of various vents in the game. The gun mod for red eco is in the form of a shotgun and a grenade launcher (demonstrating the raw power and blunt force aspect).</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Yellow Eco</h3>
    <p>Yellow eco represents accuracy and long ranged power.  When used it shoots out from the hand as a long raged projectile. It is as powerful if not more powerful than red eco. It is 1 of 4 ecos used to make light eco and the sage of yellow eco is the Yellow Sage. It takes the shape of  yellow orb gas clusters and it also comes out of various vents in the game. The gun mod for yellow eco is in the form of a rifle (demonstrating the accuracy aspect).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Blue Eco </h3>
    <p>	Blue eco represents the power of motion and speed. In The Precursor Legacy, it makes Jak run faster and it is used to activate ancient precursor artifacts and doors. It takes the shape of  blue lightning clusters and it also comes out of various vents in the game. The gun mod for blue eco is in the form of a machine gun (demonstrating the speed aspect). The sage of blue eco is known as the Blue Sage.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Dark Eco</h3>
    <p>Dark eco is represented as  a dark, poisonous substance. It contains the ability to transform, infect and sometimes kill any life form or object it comes in contact with. It is a highly unstable substance and it is also the opposite of light eco. It comes in the form of small droplets when enemies are killed, metal crates, crystals, and when in large quantities it forms into a liquid. There are only 2 known dark eco sages in the series, Gol Acheron (The Precursor Legacy) and Tym (The Lost Frontier). Dark eco is also repsonsible for Daxter's transformation in the first game. The gun mod for dark eco is known as the peace maker, which shoots electric balls that take down multiple targets. The mod really demonstrates the destruction aspect of dark eco. It also provides Jak the powers to turn into Dark Jak.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Light Eco</h3>
    <p>By nature it is the purest and rarest of all the ecos. It is created by combining all but dark eco, due to the fact that it is opposite of dark eco. Its only appearence was in The Precursor Legacy, Jak 3, and The Lost Frontier. It provides the ability for Jak to turn into Light Jak. It is one of few eco colors that can crystallize. There are no known sages of light eco, however it is believed to be unnecessary because it is made up of all eco excluding dark.</p>
