			<p>What goes into this things? A ton of css writing. Most of the programming and writing are actually done in the CSS side of this page. For instance, on the sign me up button we had to do about 6 lines of CSS writing to make it look like it does. We added a</p>
			<p>cursor: pointer; rule so when the mouse clicks on the button it turns into the hand object instead of just the arrow. We also put in a hover effect on it so when the cursor hovers over the button the letters change color to reassure that the button is the object that the user wants to click. For the check and radio buttons, there was an image that had to be inputed to make them the unique shape they are instead of the dull originals. The parent box around it had to be adjusted and it had to point to the right part of the picture so it shows the correct thing. When unclicked, the boxes and buttons remain the same. But when its checked the parent box  looks at a different position in the picture so it shows that its actually clicked. We did this by changing the background position from its original status to another part in the picture.</p>
