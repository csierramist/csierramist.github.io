        <p><strong>The SVG file, or Scalable Vector Graphic, is a picture that will change the layout according to the size of the window that the user has open. If the user has multiple windows open and needs to adjust the size of an SVG window. The content will shift and rearrange so it is still easily visible to the user. For example, if the graphic is less than 500 pixels it will switch to the other graphic. If it is larger than 500 then it will go back to the original</strong></p>
