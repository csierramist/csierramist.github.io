# Chris Sierra's Repository
Hello and welcome, first off I'd like to take the time to thank you for letting me back into your home. If this is your first time reading let me extend a personal invitation for you to sit back and relax with the wonderful world of Jak and Daxter. 
This is a repository for a high school Web Developement class.
This readme file is dedicated to introduce you to my webpage before actually clicking it. Jak and Daxter is a fantastic game series that originated from the early 2000's. Here are some clips of the entire series to introduce you.
